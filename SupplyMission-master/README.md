# HeliDrop

A simple web simulation where you control a helicopter to drop a package, powered by Matter.js physics and interactive graphics with p5.js.

## 🚁 What is HeliDrop?
HeliDrop is a browser-based sandbox demo where a helicopter hovers above the ground and drops a package. Press the **DOWN ARROW** key to release the package and watch it fall and bounce with physics. This project is ideal as a beginner’s example of combining p5.js, physics, and sprite animation.

## 🧩 Features
- Interactive helicopter and package with images
- Drop package at any time by pressing a key
- Uses Matter.js physics engine for realistic movement and collision
- Built with p5.js and p5.play.js for rendering and sprites

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) – Drawing & animation framework
- [p5.play.js](https://molleindustria.github.io/p5.play/) – Sprite & collision helper
- [Matter.js](https://brm.io/matter-js/) – 2D physics engine

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. **Clone this repo** or download the source.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Press the **DOWN ARROW** key to drop the package from the helicopter!

## 📂 File Structure
- `index.html` – Entry HTML file loading all scripts
- `sketch.js` – Main game logic (sprites, physics, controls)
- `matter.js` – Physics engine
- `p5.js`, `p5.play.js`, `p5.sound.js` – Rendering and sound (libraries)
- `helicopter.png`, `package.png` – Sprites graphics
